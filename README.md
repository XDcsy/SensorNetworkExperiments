###Sensor Network
1. **验证传感器网络连通概率与通信距离和节点个数的关系，绘制两幅图表**<br>
    **Creating 2 charts demonstrating "the probability of a sensor nework's connectivity for a geometric random graph with respect to transmission radius/with respect to number of nodes in a unit area".**<br>
    本质上是图的连通性判断。<br>
    Essentially it's task is to judge whether a graph is connected.<br>

On going.
