**1. 验证传感器网络连通概率与通信距离和节点个数的关系，绘制两幅图表**<br>
**Creating 2 charts demonstrating "the probability of a sensor nework's connectivity for a geometric random graph with respect to
transmission radius/with respect to number of nodes in a unit area".**<br>
\*本质上是图的连通性判断。
<br>
\*Essentially it's task is to judge whether a graph is connected.

**2. ①计算一个传感网络在COMPOW策略下应该使用的通信距离； ②设感应半径等于通信半径，计算传感网络的传感器覆盖率**<br>
**①Determine the common transmission power of a sensor network under COMPOW protocol; ②Assume the communication and the coverage radii are equal to each other, calculate the coverage ratio of the sensor network**<br>
